# Transferable Vesting Locker
This is a vesting smart contract.

It allows to lock tokens for a period of time and directly transfer the locked tokens to receiver addresses.

The existing vesting contracts in SUI are not transferable, so this contract is created to allow the transfer of locked tokens to other addresses.
